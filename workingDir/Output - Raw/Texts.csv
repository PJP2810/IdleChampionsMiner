You acknowledge that the use of Third Party Services may be subject to the terms and conditions of such Third Party Services, and that any contract entered into or transaction completed through Third Party Services is between only you and the relevant third party.

14.	GENERAL

14.1	Governing Law. You agree that these Terms, and your use of the Services, are governed exclusively by the laws of the Province of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein (excluding conflicts and choice of laws principles). Any contract formed through the use of the Services will be deemed to have been formed and executed within the Province of British Columbia, Canada. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is hereby expressly excluded.

14.2	Dispute Resolution

(a)	Means of Resolution. You and Codename agree that any disputes arising under these terms or otherwise in connection with your use of the Services will be resolved through arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 55, as amended from time to time.  Arbitration will be held in Vancouver, BC, Canada, and conducted in the English language.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that: (i) the courts in any relevant venue will have jurisdiction for the purposes of obtaining and enforcing injunctive or other equitable relief, and for the purposes of enforcing the decision of any arbitrator appointed in accordance with this provision, and (ii) Codename may bypass arbitration in cases of fraud or other crimes against it, and in the case of interference with its technical operations or violations of its rights or property.

(b)	Class Waiver. You acknowledge and agree that you and Codename are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Codename otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 14.2 will be deemed void.

14.3	Jurisdiction and Venue. If Section 14.2 is deemed void or is otherwise inapplicable, all disputes under these Terms will be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, provided that the courts in any relevant venue will have jurisdiction for the purposes of obtaining and enforcing injunctive or other equitable relief.

14.4	Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable for a delay or failure in performance (other than the making of payments) resulting from any cause beyond the reasonable control of such party, including but not limited to, acts of God, acts of war, riot, fire, flood, or other disaster, acts of government, strike lockout, power failures, or the inability to use or the failure of any third party telecommunications carrier or other services, which events or conditions prevent in whole or in part the performance by such party of its obligations hereunder or which renders the performance of such obligations so difficult or costly as to make performance commercially unreasonable.

14.5	Assignment. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. Codename may freely assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, either in part or in full, without notice to you.

14.6	Notice. Codename may communicate with you about the Services or these Terms by email, through the Services or by posting notices on the Site. Unless expressly prohibited by law, you consent to receive communications relating to the Services or our business relationship from Codename electronically, and agree that all notices, waivers, agreements, disclosures and other communications satisfy any legal requirements that such communications be in writing. You may provide legal notice to Codename at 9-625 Alpha Street, Victoria, British Columbia, V8Z 1B5.

14.7	Nature of Relationship. Nothing in these Terms or from your use of the Services will create or be deemed to create any partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise or other business relationship between you and Codename, even if your use of the Services is for a commercial purpose which has been authorized by us. You and Codename will, at all times, be and remain independent, third-party contractors.

14.8	Severability. The provisions of these Terms are severable. If any individual provision is held to be invalid, unenforceable or contrary to applicable law, such provision shall be construed, limited, altered or deleted, as necessary, to eliminate the invalidity, unenforceability or conflict with applicable law while endeavoring to preserve the intention of these Terms, and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

14.9	Entire Agreement. These Terms, including the Privacy Policy, together with any changes published by Codename on the  Site or otherwise communicated to you, constitute the entire agreement between you and Codename governing your use of the Services. 

14.10	Waiver. The failure by Codename to exercise or enforce any right or remedy under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or remedy.

14.11	Contact. If you wish to contact Codename with any questions, comments or concerns regarding the Services or these Terms, please refer to our Contact Us page at http://www.codenameentertainment.com/?page=contact.

Consent and will only be valid if it is reasonable to expect that the individual understands the nature, purpose and consequences of the collection, use or disclosure of the personal information to which they are consenting.  Typically, consent will be sought for the use or disclosure of personal information at the time of collection, and reasonable efforts will be made to ensure that you understand the purpose(s) for which the information will be used or disclosed.   In certain circumstances, consent regarding use or disclosure may be sought after the information has been collected, but before use, such as when Codename wishes to use personal information already in its possession for a purpose that was not previously identified. We try to limit the circumstances under which we collect and process sensitive personal information.

Users may visit our websites without telling us who they are, or revealing any information about themselves.  However, like many organizations’ websites, our web server automatically logs certain non-identifying information related to a user’s visit to the website, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user’s computer, the user’s Internet service provider (ISP), the type and version of the browser that the user is using, the date and time the user accessed our website, the Internet address of the website from which the user linked directly to our site, the operating system that the user is using, and the pages of the website that the user has visited.   We will not attempt to link this information with the identity of individuals visiting our website unless we have permission to do so.  We may, however, review server logs and anonymous traffic for system administration and security purposes, for example to detect intrusions into our network, for planning and improving web services, and to monitor and compile statistics about website usage.  The possibility therefore exists that server log data, which contains users’ IP addresses, could in instances of criminal malfeasance be used to trace and identify individuals.  In such instances, we may share raw data logs with the appropriate authorities for the purpose of investigating security breaches.


We also use cookies, analytics, pixels and other technologies in order to improve our service and your user experience, to analyze how the Site is used, and to assist with the planning and design of our games, our business and marketing.

Cookies:  “Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are used to identify you to the web server, and will tell the server who you are when you return to a page on the same website. Your browser will only send a cookie back to the domain that originally sent it to you. A cookie cannot run any programs, deliver any viruses, or send back information about your system. Session cookies expire when you close your browser.   Persistent cookies remain on your device until they are deleted or expire.  We may use cookies to determine and facilitate your access privileges on our website, to complete and support a current activity, to track website usage, to remember your language and other preferences, and to generally improve your experience.

When you visit the Site for the first time a banner informs you of the use of cookies, seeks your express consent to their use, and provides a direct link to this information page.   Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you do not wish to have cookies on your system, you should adjust your browser settings to decline them or to alert you when cookies are being sent.    If you decline cookies, you will still be able to use the website or application, but your ability to access certain features and functions may be affected.

Google Analytics:  We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about the use of the Site, and to report on activities, trends and user behavior patterns.  We do this to obtain an overview of how people are accessing and using the Site, as well as to provide marketing services to you.  Information that we use from Google Analytics includes: IP address; time per page; pages per session; bounce rate; device information; frequency of use; language; demographic; geographic and interests.  You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.  You can opt out by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.  

Retargeting/Remarketing:  We use Google AdWords Remarketing and other tools to advertise our games across the Internet.  When you visit the Site, your device will be tagged with a cookie which will allow relevant ads, tailored to you based upon which parts of the Site you have viewed, to be displayed. Remarketing allows us to tailor our marketing to better suit your needs and only display ads that are relevant to you.   You can opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting http://www.google.com/settings/ads. 

Pixels:  Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) are tiny snippets of JavaScript code that we have placed on the Site.  They may be used in connection with some online services to track the actions of users of the online services, measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about the usage of online services and response rates. For example, we use pixels to measure the return on investment of Facebook Ads by reporting on the actions people take after viewing those ads.  We also use them to show you more relevant advertisements on Facebook based on your traffic on our Site.  Facebook may use cookies, beacons and similar technology as part of this process.  You may opt out of Facebook’s Custom Audience ads here: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.

Retention of Personal Information
Subject to any legal or accounting requirements, we will retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.  Personal information that is no longer required will be destroyed, erased or made anonymous, although copies of deleted information may continue to exist on back-up media.  You may request the erasure of your personal information at any time, which we will endeavor to do without undue delay as required by applicable law.  Written requests should be sent to the Privacy Officer at the address set out above (see: Accountability and Openness / Compliance)

Purpose - Why We Collect, Use and Disclose Information
We will identify the purposes for which we collect personal information before or when we request the information.

We comply with Canadian “anti-spam” legislation, and will only send you electronic communications as permitted by law.  Note that you may always unsubscribe from our electronic communications by following the “unsubscribe” link clearly included in each communication, or by notifying the Privacy Officer at the address set out above (see: Accountability and Openness / Compliance).

Legal Basis for the Use of Your Personal Information
We will only process your personal information where we have a legal basis to do so.  The legal basis will depend upon the reason or reasons that we collected and require the use of your information.  The legal basis will generally be:

•	The performance of the contract that we have with you, including for the purpose of allowing you to access and play our games.

•	Our legitimate interests, such as providing you with the best appropriate content for the Site, emails and newsletters, to enhance user experience, improve and promote our games and the content on our Site, and for administrative, fraud detection and legal purposes.

•	To protect your vital interests, or those of another natural person.

because you have consented to our use of your personal information for particular purposes, such as the creation of a user accounts in order to access our games.  You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting the Privacy Officer at the address set out above (see: Accountability and Openness / Compliance)

Disclosure to Third Parties
Your personally identifiable information is never sold and, except as specifically provided in this Policy or permitted by law, will not be shared with third parties unless we provide you with both prior notice and choice.  

You acknowledge that, in the course of our supply of products and services to you, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your information to third party subcontractors.  Third party subcontractors may include web hosts and payment processors.  If we transfer any personal information to a third party subcontractor, we will provide the subcontractors only with the information needed to perform the subcontracted service, and will use appropriate contractual or other means to provide a comparable level of protection while the information is being used by them. Without limitation, we will ensure that our third party subcontractors are bound to adhere to this policy, appropriate confidentiality provisions and all applicable laws. Details regarding the personal information that we make available to our third party contractors, and how it is used, is available by contacting the Privacy Officer at the address set out above (see: Accountability and Openness / Compliance).  Any request made by you to correct, change or erase your personal information will be promptly communicated to any third party subcontractors in possession of that information.  However, you agree not to hold us liable for the actions or inactions of any third party subcontractor, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and understand that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you. 
We may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your knowledge or consent where we are permitted or required to do so by applicable law, government request, request of a law enforcement agency, search warrant, subpoena or court order, or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with such law, request, warrant, subpoena or court order, or to protect our assets, the users of our websites, products or services, or the public.

Subject to certain restrictions, Codename may also use and disclose your personal information without your knowledge or consent where necessary in connection with a proposed or completed business transaction.  “Business transaction” includes those transactions described in the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 200, c. 5, as amended. In each such case, Codename and the other part(ies) to the transaction or proposed transaction will enter into an agreement limiting the purposes for which the personal information may be used and disclosed, ensuring its protection by means appropriate to the sensitivity of the information, and providing for the return or destruction of the information if the transaction does not proceed, or if the transaction does proceed, to notify you within a reasonable time that your personal information has been disclosed.
Finally, extreme caution and common sense should be exercised when you disclose your personal information directly to third parties, including other users, in connection with your use of certain of our games, applications, chat rooms, venues, and other web-based services.  You acknowledge that, in such cases, this Policy does not apply as Codename cannot control the collection, use or disclosure of any personal information that you provide directly to third parties and, accordingly, will not be liable for any misuse by such third parties.  

Safeguards – How Information is Protected
We have implemented reasonable physical, organizational, contractual and technological security measures to protect personal information in our possession or under our control from loss or theft, and from unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification, regardless of the format in which the information is held.  The safeguards applied will depend on the sensitivity of the personal information, with the highest level of protection given to the most sensitive personal information.   We use user IDs, passwords, and encryption technology, maintain our servers in locked premises, and restrict the employees and contractors who have access to personal information to those having a “need to know” and who are bound by confidentiality obligations, in order to ensure that information is handled and stored in a confidential and secure manner.  Any credit card information that you submit will not be stored on our servers, but rather will be sent to a PCI Level 1-compliant payment processor for storage. When destroying personal information, we delete electronically stored personal information and shred any tangible materials containing personal information.   While we will endeavour to destroy all copies of personal information, you acknowledge that deleted information may continue to exist on back-up media but will not be used unless permitted by law. 
We will continually review and update our security policies and controls as technology evolves.  However, no security technology can be guaranteed to be failsafe.  Using the Internet or other public means of communication to collect and process personal data may involve the transmission of data on an international basis and across networks not owned and/or operated by us.  Therefore, by downloading and using our information, applications and services, and/or communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge and agree to our processing of personal information in this way and agree that we are not responsible for any personal information which is lost, or which is altered, intercepted or stored by a third party without authorization. 

Accuracy / Access
Codename has a responsibility to ensure that all personal information contained in our records or which is disclosed to third parties for the purposes described above is accurate, complete and up-to-date.  You may make a request in writing for access to your personal information by contacting the Privacy Officer at the address set out above (see: Accountability and Openness / Compliance).  Including “Request personal information” in the subject line of your email will facilitate compliance with your request.  We will inform you of your personal information held by us, and provide an account of the use that has been made of the information, as well as identify any third parties to whom the information has been disclosed.  

In certain circumstances, Codename may not be able to provide you with access to all or some of your personal information, in which case you will be advised in writing of the reasons for our inability to provide you with the information.  

If you demonstrate the inaccuracy or incompleteness of your personal information, the information will be amended as appropriate.  You should advise us immediately if you discover inaccuracies in our data, if your personal information changes.  Except as provided by applicable law, you have the right to require that we erase any of your personal information without undue delay, particularly in cases where the information is no longer required by us, you no longer consent to our use of your personal information, or if our use was in violation of this Policy or applicable law.   All notices and requests regarding inaccuracies, changes or erasure should be in writing and sent to the Privacy Officer at the addresses set out above (see: Accountability and Openness / Compliance).

International Transfer and Storage of Information
You acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be transmitted, transferred, processed, and/or stored outside of Canada, including in the United States.   We will use reasonable means to ensure that your information is protected, but cannot guarantee that the laws of any foreign jurisdiction will accord the same degree of protection as the laws of Canada.  By submitting your personal information to us, you consent to the transmission, transfer, processing and/or storage of your personal information outside of Canada.

You acknowledge that these third parties may collect data from users or their computers.  The accessing and use of third party websites is at your own risk, and we cannot assume responsibility for the privacy practices, policies or actions of the third parties who operate those websites.  This Policy applies only to Codename websites and applications, and we encourage you to review the privacy policies contained on each Internet site and in each application that you use.

You can start the adventures from the Campaign Map just like you would any other adventure, except that you must spend Event Tokens (Fresh Fish) to start them. The base adventure will unlock a new Champion, and the variants and free play provide chests that can be used to gear up the Champion. When the event ends, you keep the new Champion, any gear you have aquired for them, and a gain a boost to your permanent campaign favor.

<span class=""italic_title"">How do I get more Event Tokens (Fresh Fish)?</span>
Event Tokens will drop periodically from monsters in all adventures and campaigns. You will also receive Event Tokens along with your offline gold gains when you load the game after having been offline for a while. Finally, using Bounty Contracts during the event will award Event Tokens at a rate of 2 per minute (60 for small contracts, 480 for medium, and 960 for large).

<span class=""italic_title"">How do I use the new Champion I've unlocked?</span>
Once you complete the event's base adventure, you can swap in the new Champion you've unlocked by clicking on the portrait of whomever they swap with, then clicking the swap button the top-right corner of their portrait on their character sheet. You can only have one Champion from each bench slot in your formation at a time.

<span class=""italic_title"">How do I gear up the new Champion I've unlocked?</span>
Equipment for event champions appear in event-specific chests. They cannot receive gear from normal silver or gold chests. You can earn event chests by completing event variants, the event free play, or by purchasing them directly for Event Tokens.

<span class=""italic_title"">Why is the Divine Favor in the event different from the base campaign Divine Favor?</span>
In order to provide a more balanced experience for all players, each event has a different type of Divine Favor, which means everyone starts on relatively even footing. You still have your gear, unlocked Champions, and experience with formations to give you an advantage over newer players.

<span class=""italic_title"">What happens to my Event Divine Favor after the event ends?</span>
Once the event ends you'll have an opportunity to convert your Event Divine Favor into a different deity's Divine Favor for the campaign of your choice, so your hard earned Event Divine Favor will not go to waste.

"<span class=""italic_title"">How do I play the Gardener of the Galaxy Event?</span>
The Gardener of the Galaxy Event is a limited-time campaign with five objectives and free play. You must do a soft reset or abandon your current objective to play them. To do a soft reset, level Nate Dragon (the 20th Crusader) up to level 150 and use his ""Reset the World"" ability (if this is your first time playing that will take between 1 to 3 days on average). The first objective costs 100 Seed Spores to begin, so make sure you have some saved up before you reset.

<span class=""italic_title"">How do I get more Seed Spores?</span>
Seed Spores will drop from monsters at a fairly regular rate in any objective. They are also awarded based on an averaged drop rate when you use Warp cards. You can save up your Seed Spores and do a bunch of Gardener of the Galaxy Objectives in a row, so don't worry if you're a few days away from resetting when the event begins.

<span class=""italic_title"">I unlocked the new Crusaders, but I can't find them to put in my formation!</span>
Broot and Robbie Raccoon can replace Jason, Master of Shadows and Prince Sal, the Merman on your bench and in your formation. Look for the swap button next to the level-up button on Merci and Sarah to swap them. You can only have one Crusader from each bench seat in your formation at once.

<span class=""italic_title"">Will the Gardener of the Galaxy Crusaders stick around after the event ends?</span>
Yes, as long as you unlock the Gardener of the Galaxy Crusaders before the event ends, you'll be able to swap them into your formation at any time.

<span class=""italic_title"">How do I get equipment for the Gardener of the Galaxy Crusaders?</span>
Equipment cards for Gardener of the Galaxy Crusaders can only be found in Gardener's Chests, which can be earned by completing Gardener of the Galaxy objectives, Gardener of the Galaxy free play, or by purchasing them from the store. Jeweled Gardener's Chests will be awarded from completing the 'Infinity Stone', 'Displaced Wildlife', and 'Gardeners, Unite!' objectives, and additional Gardener's Chests can be earned by doing Gardener of the Galaxy Free Play. Jeweled Gardener's Chests will remain available in the in-game store for 2 days following the end of the event, <span class=""italic"">but you are only able to buy them for Seed Spores while the event is still running</span>.

<span class=""italic_title"">What happens if the event ends while I'm still doing an Event Objective or Free Play?</span>
You will be able to finish up that event objective or free play and earn the full rewards even if you don't finish until after the event ends. This includes permanently unlocking an Event Crusader if that's the particular objective you're on.",612,event14faqs
