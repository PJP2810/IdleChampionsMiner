[],[],"The Summer Solstice has always been celebrated with bonfires and rituals to ""tame"" or ""drive down"" dragons. The bonfires and ""charms against dragons"" (chanted prayers or mock-spells said over a talon, scale, or other ""dragon relic"") still occur, even among non-clergy, after dusk. Unfortunately, this year, the charms don't appear to be working. Luckily, Binwin Bronzebottom and his team of daring minions are on the job... so they'll probably need your help. This limited time event will run until Monday, June 25th at noon PDT.","Wednesday June 13th, 2018 2:00:00PM",2021-01-01 00:59:59,"[11, 13, 14]",40,news_26.png,,2018-06-13 14:00:00,0,1528923600,New Event: Dragondown!
