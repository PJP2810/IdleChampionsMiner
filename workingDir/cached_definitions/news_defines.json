For our intrepid band of heroes this is just enough time to take on a well-paying contract for a journey into the High Forest in search of a rare elven artifact. Complete the adventure to recruit Catti-Brie, a human fighter and our fourth Companion of the Hall! This event runs until Tuesday, May 15th, at noon PDT.",
