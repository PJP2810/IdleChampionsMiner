Codename reserves the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you.\r\n\r\n13.\tTHIRD PARTY SERVICES\r\n\r\nThe Services may enable you to access third party websites, applications or materials linked to or accessible through the Services (\u201cThird Party Services\u201d). Codename provides access to Third Party Services as a convenience only, and such access does not imply any warranties, representations, endorsements, approvals or verification by Codename of such Third Party Services. You acknowledge that the use of Third Party Services may be subject to the terms and conditions of such Third Party Services, and that any contract entered into or transaction completed through Third Party Services is between only you and the relevant third party.\r\n\r\n14.\tGENERAL\r\n\r\n14.1\tGoverning Law. You agree that these Terms, and your use of the Services, are governed exclusively by the laws of the Province of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein (excluding conflicts and choice of laws principles). Any contract formed through the use of the Services will be deemed to have been formed and executed within the Province of British Columbia, Canada. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is hereby expressly excluded.\r\n\r\n14.2\tDispute Resolution\r\n\r\n(a)\tMeans of Resolution. You and Codename agree that any disputes arising under these terms or otherwise in connection with your use of the Services will be resolved through arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 55, as amended from time to time.  Arbitration will be held in Vancouver, BC, Canada, and conducted in the English language.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that: (i) the courts in any relevant venue will have jurisdiction for the purposes of obtaining and enforcing injunctive or other equitable relief, and for the purposes of enforcing the decision of any arbitrator appointed in accordance with this provision, and (ii) Codename may bypass arbitration in cases of fraud or other crimes against it, and in the case of interference with its technical operations or violations of its rights or property.\r\n\r\n(b)\tClass Waiver. You acknowledge and agree that you and Codename are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Codename otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 14.2 will be deemed void.\r\n\r\n14.3\tJurisdiction and Venue. If Section 14.2 is deemed void or is otherwise inapplicable, all disputes under these Terms will be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, provided that the courts in any relevant venue will have jurisdiction for the purposes of obtaining and enforcing injunctive or other equitable relief.\r\n\r\n14.4\tForce Majeure. Neither party shall be liable for a delay or failure in performance (other than the making of payments) resulting from any cause beyond the reasonable control of such party, including but not limited to, acts of God, acts of war, riot, fire, flood, or other disaster, acts of government, strike lockout, power failures, or the inability to use or the failure of any third party telecommunications carrier or other services, which events or conditions prevent in whole or in part the performance by such party of its obligations hereunder or which renders the performance of such obligations so difficult or costly as to make performance commercially unreasonable.\r\n\r\n14.5\tAssignment. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. Codename may freely assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, either in part or in full, without notice to you.\r\n\r\n14.6\tNotice. Codename may communicate with you about the Services or these Terms by email, through the Services or by posting notices on the Site. Unless expressly prohibited by law, you consent to receive communications relating to the Services or our business relationship from Codename electronically, and agree that all notices, waivers, agreements, disclosures and other communications satisfy any legal requirements that such communications be in writing. You may provide legal notice to Codename at 9-625 Alpha Street, Victoria, British Columbia, V8Z 1B5.\r\n\r\n14.7\tNature of Relationship. Nothing in these Terms or from your use of the Services will create or be deemed to create any partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise or other business relationship between you and Codename, even if your use of the Services is for a commercial purpose which has been authorized by us. You and Codename will, at all times, be and remain independent, third-party contractors.\r\n\r\n14.8\tSeverability. The provisions of these Terms are severable. If any individual provision is held to be invalid, unenforceable or contrary to applicable law, such provision shall be construed, limited, altered or deleted, as necessary, to eliminate the invalidity, unenforceability or conflict with applicable law while endeavoring to preserve the intention of these Terms, and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\r\n\r\n14.9\tEntire Agreement. These Terms, including the Privacy Policy, together with any changes published by Codename on the  Site or otherwise communicated to you, constitute the entire agreement between you and Codename governing your use of the Services. \r\n\r\n14.10\tWaiver. The failure by Codename to exercise or enforce any right or remedy under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or remedy.\r\n\r\n14.11\tContact. If you wish to contact Codename with any questions, comments or concerns regarding the Services or these Terms, please refer to our Contact Us page at http://www.codenameentertainment.com/?page=contact.\r\n\r\n==================================================\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy\r\n\r\nThis Privacy Policy (\u201cPolicy\u201d) describes the personal information that Codename Entertainment Inc. (\u201cCodename\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) collects from or about you when you use our websites, games and related services, including applications for mobile devices, or participate in our events, how we use that information, and to whom we disclose it.   \u201cPersonal information\u201d means information about an identifiable individual, and does not include general, statistical or aggregated information.       \r\nPlease read this Policy carefully.  If you do not agree with this Policy, you should not access or use our websites or applications.  This Policy should be read in conjunction with the www.codenameentertainment.com website Terms of Use, into which it is incorporated by reference. \r\nThis Policy was last updated on August 16, 2017.  We reserve the right to revise this Policy at any time and, as such, you should review its terms each time that you use our websites or applications. Any changes to this Policy will be promptly communicated on this page, but will not go into effect until at least five (5) days after they are posted.\r\nAccountability and Openness / Compliance\r\nCodename is responsible for personal information under our control.  We have established policies and procedures to effectively safeguard any confidential personal information that we have on file or which we collect, and to deal with complaints and inquiries.  We only collect personally identifiable data when it is voluntarily submitted by you through the use of our games, websites and applications, and are committed to maintaining the accuracy, confidentiality and security of your personal information.  We will ensure that you have access to information regarding the policies and procedures that we use to manage your personal information.  \r\n\r\nCodename has designated a privacy officer (\u201cPrivacy Officer\u201d) who is accountable for our compliance with this Policy, and for ensuring that information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information is easily accessible.  All questions or concerns regarding this Policy and our compliance with it should be directed to the Privacy Officer in writing, and sent by email to privacy@codenameentertainment.com or by post to:\r\n\r\nPrivacy Officer \r\nCodename Entertainment Inc.\r\n#9 \u2013 625 Alpha Street\r\nVictoria, BC\r\nCanada V8Z 1B5\r\n\r\nEvery complaint or challenge regarding our compliance with this Policy will be investigated, and where a deficiency is found to exist, we will take appropriate measures to address it.  This may include amending our policies and procedures as necessary. We will also cooperate with regulatory authorities to resolve any complaints that cannot be resolved between us and an individual user.  \r\n\r\nConsent\r\nExcept as expressly provided in this Policy or as otherwise permitted by law, consent is required for the collection of personal information and the subsequent use or disclosure of that information.  Consent may be express or implied.  For consent to be meaningful, it must be informed consent and will only be valid if it is reasonable to expect that the individual understands the nature, purpose and consequences of the collection, use or disclosure of the personal information to which they are consenting.  Typically, consent will be sought for the use or disclosure of personal information at the time of collection, and reasonable efforts will be made to ensure that you understand the purpose(s) for which the information will be used or disclosed.   In certain circumstances, consent regarding use or disclosure may be sought after the information has been collected, but before use, such as when Codename wishes to use personal information already in its possession for a purpose that was not previously identified.\r\n\r\nBy voluntarily submitting your personal information, registering with us, or using our websites, games, applications, or web-based services, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Policy and to our use of your personal information in accordance with this Policy.  You may make inquiries, or change or withdraw your consent to the collection, use and/or disclosure of your personal information at any time by contacting the Privacy Officer in writing at either of the addresses listed above.  In some circumstances, a change or withdrawal of consent may affect your ability to use an application and/or our ability to provide you with information, products or services.  \r\n\r\nCollection and Retention of Information\r\nWe collect personal information only to the extent that it is necessary for the purposes set out below (see: Purpose - Why We Collect, Use and Disclose Information).  In most cases, we will collect personal information directly from you when you interact with us with respect to our games, websites, applications, events, or any other product or service that we offer.  Occasionally, we may collect personal information from a third party based on your consent or as otherwise permitted by law.  Personal information will always be collected using means that are fair and lawful.\r\n\r\nExamples of personal information that we may collect, use and disclose include your name and email address, gender, whether you are a minor, and other information that you may provide to us in conjunction with your use of our games, websites, applications, and services.  Subject to any legal or accounting requirements, we will retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.  Personal information that is no longer required will be destroyed, erased or made anonymous, although copies of deleted information may continue to exist on back-up media.\r\n\r\nUsers may visit our websites without telling us who they are, or revealing any information about themselves.  However, like many organizations\u2019 websites, our web server automatically logs certain non-identifying information related to a user\u2019s visit to the website, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user\u2019s computer, the user\u2019s Internet service provider (ISP), the type and version of the browser that the user is using, the date and time the user accessed our website, the Internet address of the website from which the user linked directly to our site, the operating system that the user is using, and the pages of the website that the user has visited.   We will not attempt to link this information with the identity of individuals visiting our website unless we have permission to do so.  We may, however, review server logs and anonymous traffic for system administration and security purposes, for example to detect intrusions into our network, for planning and improving web services, and to monitor and compile statistics about website usage.  The possibility therefore exists that server log data, which contains users\u2019 IP addresses, could in instances of criminal malfeasance be used to trace and identify individuals.  In such instances, we may share raw data logs with the appropriate authorities for the purpose of investigating security breaches.\r\n\r\nIf you provide comments or other feedback to us, you agree that such comments or other feedback become the property of Codename, and we may use and disclose them for any purpose provided that we do not associate them with your personally identifiable information.\r\n\r\nCookies\r\nA \u201ccookie\u201d is a small piece of information stored on your computer by a web page. It is used to identify you to the web server. It tells the server who you are when you return to a page on the same website. Your browser will only send a cookie back to the domain that originally sent it to you. A cookie cannot run any programs, deliver any viruses, or send back information about your system. \r\n\r\nWe may use cookies to determine your access privileges on our websites, to complete and support a current activity, and to track website usage.\r\nMost web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you do not wish to have cookies on your system, you should adjust your browser settings to decline them or to alert you when cookies are being sent.    If you decline cookies, you will still be able to use the website or application, but your ability to access certain features and functions may be affected.\r\nPurpose - Why We Collect, Use and Disclose Information\r\nWe will identify the purposes for which we collect personal information before or when we request the information.  We will not collect personal information which is not necessary and, except as specified below, will not use or disclose personal information for any purpose other than the purpose(s) for which it was collected without first obtaining your consent.  The information that we collect is used and disclosed only for business purposes.  These include:  \r\n\r\n\u2022\tto enable you to register to access restricted areas of our websites and/or to subscribe to and use our games and applications, and to communicate with you regarding their use;\r\n\r\n\u2022\tto identify you in our games, and to display you in rankings and leaderboards;\r\n\r\n\u2022\tto provide you with support updates, forum notifications and game bonuses;\r\n\r\n\u2022\tto provide you with personalized content, and to maximize our ability to provide you with information that is useful and relevant to you;\r\n\r\n\u2022\tto allow you to participate in contests and rewards programs;\r\n\r\n\u2022\tto obtain feedback regarding our games, applications, websites and events; \r\n\r\n\u2022\tto verify that any information submitted by you is accurate and complete;\r\n\r\n\u2022\tto communicate with you and to create a record of your involvement with us; \r\n\r\n\u2022\tto track your interests and preferences in order to customize and enhance your use of our games;\r\n\r\n\u2022\tto conduct polls and surveys;\r\n\r\n\u2022\tto provide you with information and promotional materials regarding Codename, and our products and services;\r\n\r\n\u2022\tinternal business purposes, such as administering or improving our games, applications and websites;\r\n\r\n\u2022\tto protect us against error, fraud, theft or damage to our assets, our business or our property;\r\n\r\n\u2022\tto comply with any legal, accounting and regulatory requirements, including reporting requirements; \r\n\r\n\u2022\tany other reasonable purpose for which you provide consent, or for which consent may be implied in accordance with this Policy and applicable law.\r\n\r\nWhere personal information that has been collected is to be used for a purpose not previously identified, and for which consent cannot be reasonably implied, the new purpose will be identified and consent obtained prior to the use of that information for the new purpose unless otherwise permitted by law.\r\n\r\nDisclosure to Third Parties\r\nYour personally identifiable information is never sold and, except as specifically provided in this Policy or permitted by law, will not be shared with third parties unless we provide you with both prior notice and choice.  \r\n\r\nYou acknowledge that, in the course of our supply of products and services to you, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your information to third party subcontractors.  Third party subcontractors may include web hosts and payment processors.  If we transfer any personal information to a third party subcontractor, we will provide the subcontractors only with the information needed to perform the subcontracted service, and will use appropriate contractual or other means to provide a comparable level of protection while the information is being used by them. However, you agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any third party subcontractor, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and understand that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you. \r\nWe may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your knowledge or consent where we are permitted or required to do so by applicable law, government request, request of a law enforcement agency, search warrant, subpoena or court order, or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with such law, request, warrant, subpoena or court order, or to protect our assets, the users of our websites, products or services, or the public.\r\n\r\nSubject to certain restrictions, Codename may also use and disclose your personal information without your knowledge or consent where necessary in connection with a proposed or completed business transaction.  \u201cBusiness transaction\u201d includes those transactions described in the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 200, c. 5, as amended. In each such case, Codename and the other part(ies) to the transaction or proposed transaction will enter into an agreement limiting the purposes for which the personal information may be used and disclosed, ensuring its protection by means appropriate to the sensitivity of the information, and providing for the return or destruction of the information if the transaction does not proceed, or if the transaction does proceed, to notify you within a reasonable time that your personal information has been disclosed.\r\nFinally, extreme caution and common sense should be exercised when you disclose your personal information directly to third parties, including other users, in connection with your use of certain of our games, applications, chat rooms, venues, and other web-based services.  You acknowledge that, in such cases, this Policy does not apply as Codename cannot control the collection, use or disclosure of any personal information that you provide directly to third parties and, accordingly, will not be liable for any misuse by such third parties.  \r\n\r\nSafeguards \u2013 How Information is Protected\r\nWe have implemented reasonable physical, organizational, contractual and technological security measures to protect personal information in our possession or under our control from loss or theft, and from unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification, regardless of the format in which the information is held.  The safeguards applied will depend on the sensitivity of the personal information, with the highest level of protection given to the most sensitive personal information.   We use user IDs, passwords, and encryption technology, maintain our servers in locked premises, and restrict the employees and contractors who have access to personal information to those having a \u201cneed to know\u201d and who are bound by confidentiality obligations, in order to ensure that information is handled and stored in a confidential and secure manner.  Any credit card information that you submit will not be stored on our servers, but rather will be sent to a PCI Level 1-compliant payment processor for storage. When destroying personal information, we delete electronically stored personal information and shred any tangible materials containing personal information.   While we will endeavour to destroy all copies of personal information, you acknowledge that deleted information may continue to exist on back-up media but will not be used unless permitted by law. \r\nWe will continually review and update our security policies and controls as technology evolves.

Event?</span>\r\nThe Fleetswake Event is a brand new temporary campaign with a single adventure and three variants. You can start the adventures from the Campaign Map just like you would any other adventure, except that you must spend Event Tokens (Fresh Fish) to start them. The base adventure will unlock a new Champion, and the variants and free play provide chests that can be used to gear up the Champion. When the event ends, you keep the new Champion, any gear you have aquired for them, and a gain a boost to your permanent campaign favor.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How do I get more Event Tokens (Fresh Fish)?</span>\r\nEvent Tokens will drop periodically from monsters in all adventures and campaigns. You will also receive Event Tokens along with your offline gold gains when you load the game after having been offline for a while. Finally, using Bounty Contracts during the event will award Event Tokens at a rate of 2 per minute (60 for small contracts, 480 for medium, and 960 for large).\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How do I use the new Champion I've unlocked?</span>\r\nOnce you complete the event's base adventure, you can swap in the new Champion you've unlocked by clicking on the portrait of whomever they swap with, then clicking the swap button the top-right corner of their portrait on their character sheet. You can only have one Champion from each bench slot in your formation at a time.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How do I gear up the new Champion I've unlocked?</span>\r\nEquipment for event champions appear in event-specific chests. They cannot receive gear from normal silver or gold chests. You can earn event chests by completing event variants, the event free play, or by purchasing them directly for Event Tokens.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">Why is the Divine Favor in the event different from the base campaign Divine Favor?</span>\r\nIn order to provide a more balanced experience for all players, each event has a different type of Divine Favor, which means everyone starts on relatively even footing. You still have your gear, unlocked Champions, and experience with formations to give you an advantage over newer players.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What happens to my Event Divine Favor after the event ends?</span>\r\nOnce the event ends you'll have an opportunity to convert your Event Divine Favor into a different deity's Divine Favor for the campaign of your choice, so your hard earned Event Divine Favor will not go to waste. The more Divine Favor you earn in the event, the bigger the amount you earn for your permanent campaign."},{"id":532,"key":"hero_info_dialog_level","contents":"LEVEL"},{"id":533,"key":"hero_info_dialog_formation_buffs","contents":"Formation Buffs"},{"id":534,"key":"hero_info_dialog_details","contents":"Click on an Upgrade / Equipment to view description"},{"id":535,"key":"protip_level_multiples_title","contents":"Buy Multiple Levels"},{"id":536,"key":"protip_level_multiples","contents":"Finding it too slow to buy lots of levels for your crusaders?\r\n\r\nClick this button to change the number of levels you buy with each click of the level up button."},{"id":537,"key":"objective_tooltip_reset_help","contents":"To reset the world, get Nate Dragon to level 150 and purchase his Reset the World upgrade!"},{"id":538,"key":"button_text_help","contents":"Help"},{"id":539,"key":"area_complete_text","contents":"AREA COMPLETE"},{"id":540,"key":"hero_list_item_xp_point_desc","contents":"Each Point increases DPS of $(hero) by $(percent)%"},{"id":541,"key":"protip_move_emo","contents":"You just bought Emo's Lone Wolf formation ability!
