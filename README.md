# Idle Champions Miner

Soon to be growing compilation of python scripting to scrape the `cached_definitions.json` file from Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms. 


## Plans/Goals for these scripts:
* Scrape all the data from Idle Champions `cached_definitions.json`
	* Format data into csv/xml (or other suitable file) for the following groupings:
		* Hero Char Sheets
        * Hero Upgrades
        * Hero Scaling
        * Loot drop rates
        * other things I can't think of at 2:20am
	* Reformat above data into human readable (PDF?) file
		* Layout in progress
